The shoes were universally panned at the time of its original release, but it opened doors for Nike to get sexier with leather materials and animal-print textures, which is the standard for today’s higher-end retro product offerings. This Summer, Jordan Brand will present the Air Jordan 2 Decon, a slimmed-down version of the 1987 silhouette.By removing the excess padding, the Air Jordan 2 Decon is obviously much slimmer on feet and lends to the dominant casual/lifestyle trend. Color-blocking options appear to be the usual tonal style; seen here is a mint and Bordeaux while an unseen “Sail” colorway is coming as well.

But those will pale in comparison to what’s next: an OFF WHITE Air Jordan 1 collaboration. After Hiroshi Fujiwara touched the 1985 grail with his fragment 1s, it doesn’t look like the Air Jordan 1 Retro High is off-limits on the collaborative front anymore, and this OFF WHITE Jordan 1 is the craziest concept we’ve seen yet. The Air Jordan 1 “Chicago” colorway serves as the base, while the medial side Swoosh is ditched entirely (you can still see the original perforations) for an OFF WHITE branded stamp of approval featuring Beaverton, Oregon and the year the model initially came to be: 1985. Check out a brief look at the OFF WHITE Air Jordan 1 sample below, and we’ll keep you updated if this pair will actually release right here on Sneaker News.
