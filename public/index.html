            <div><br>The Nike Flyknit Racer is finally getting the Triple White treatment, and for a good cause too.
                The Swoosh is tapping into their Greek mythology background once again, this time paying homage to the
                goddess of victory with the Nike Flyknit Racer Goddess set to drop on March 8th in honor of
                International Women’s Day.
                And guys, don’t worry – this Triple White Flyknit Racer should be releasing in a full size run. This
                isn’t a traditional Triple White option either,
                as the midsole gets an off-white Sail treatment while you won’t have to worry too much about keeping the
                outsole clean thanks to the standard black peeking through.
                Check out more detailed shots below and expect this pair to drop on Nike.com next week.aaaaaaaa
